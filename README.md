# Python Community Code of Conduct

This repository holds a work-in-progress version of the new Python Community Code of Conduct. This draft Code of Conduct is still under discussion by the Python Code of Conduct working group. The PyCon U.S. Code of Conduct and incident response procedures are included in this repository as examples until new procedures can be put in place.

No changes are final until approved by the Python Software Foundation board.
