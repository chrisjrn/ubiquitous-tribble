This document summarizes the procedures the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group uses to discuss and document Code of Conduct reports.

# Documentation and Privacy Policies

Depending on how the Code of Conduct committee is set up, there may be different places where information about Code of Conduct reports may be accessible:

 * Personal email of Code of Conduct committee members
 * Archives of committee mailing lists
 * Logs from committee online chats
 * Shared online documents, such as Google Docs or Next Cloud documents

In all cases, documents and notes should only be available to committee members who do not have a conflict of interest for the report. This requires communities to choose documentation tools that will meet their privacy needs.

## Committee shared email address

Code of Conduct committees need to be able to be reached by one email address. It is recommended that the committee use an alias which forwards email to individual members.

Using a mailing list is not recommended. This is because mailing lists typically archive all emails. This means new committee members gain access to all past archives. They can deliberately or accidentally see past reports where they have a conflict of interest. In order to prevent potential conflicts of interest, it is recommended to not have a mailing list archive.

## Committee online discussion

A Code of Conduct committee may have an online, real-time discussion forum, such as Slack, Zulip, or IRC. If the online chat platform allows, it is recommended to set the committee channel to have past history not be available to new committee members who join the channel.

When a report comes in and a discussion needs to happen in an online space, care needs to be taken to avoid conflicts of interest. In the committee chat channel, state 'We have a report that involves [REPORTED PERSON]'. Do not say who was the reporter or who were witnesses if the report was sent to an individual committee member. Ask which committee members do not have a conflict of interest. Add those committee members to a group discussion, separate from the committee channel. If a committee member does not respond, do not add them to the new group discussion. If a committee member finds they have a conflict of interest because of who reported the incident or who witnessed it, they should recluse themselves from the discussion.

Committee members should not use bots or IRC bouncers to log the group discussions. All documentation of discussions and decisions should be put in online, shared documentation.

If no online real-time discussion forum is used, committee members without a conflict of interest will discuss the case on a separate email thread. If no committee member has a conflict of interest, and the committee email is an alias, the committee may reply to the alias to discuss the issues.

## Shared Documentation

The Code of Conduct committee should keep two types of shared documents:

 * A spreadsheet with the status of open and closed cases
 * A separate document for each report

### Status Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet with status of open and closed cases should have the following format:

| Safety risk?  | Risk of repeating? | Status | Code Name  | Date & Time  | Actions needed | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | Ongoing | home shelf  | 07/07 8:30am and 07/08 12:30pm | Team on the lookout for reported person | Temporary ban for the remainder of the event, reevaluate attendance for next year |
| No | Maybe | Resolved | stunned bulb | 07/07 8:00pm | - | Verbal warning |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Keep resolutions and notes vague enough that enforcement team members with a conflict of interest don't know the details of the incident. Use gender neutral language when describing the reported person in the spreadsheet.

### Report Documentation

Each report should be assigned a code name, using an [online random phrase generator](http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomPhrase). The code name should be used in the document's title. Only committee members without a conflict of interest should have access to the report documentation.

Report documents should include:

 * A summary of a verbal report, or the text of an emailed report. Use neutral, non-judgmental words to describe the behavior. Where possible, separate out the behavior of the reported person and the impact on the reporter.
 * A summary of committee discussions, including whether the report is in scope
 * Proposed behavioral modification plan
 * Proposed consequences for the reported behavior
 * A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with community moderators, administrators, registration, or other event organizers about the proposed consequences and behavioral modification plan
 * A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with the reported person
 * The text that was sent to follow up with the reporter

All discussion summaries should include dates that they took place.

### Privacy Concerns

There are some common privacy pitfalls to online tools like Google Docs. Make sure to always share the document with committee members who don't have a conflict of interest, rather than turning link sharing on. This prevents people outside of the committee from accessing the documents.

Another common issue is that when a folder is shared with the whole committee, even if a person doesn't have edit or view access to an individual report, they can still see the document's title. This can give information away, such as the person who made the report. Some communities use initials in the report title instead. That can still reveal information, and it makes it hard to talk about report status in public spaces (such as an event). The committee may want to assign a code name to each report, and reference that name in the report title and status spreadsheet. You can use an [online random phrase generator](http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomPhrase) to create the code name.

When on-boarding new committee members, they should be provided with a list of names of people who have been reported in a Code of Conduct incident. The new committee member should state whether they have any conflicts of interest with reviewing documentation for those cases. If not, they will be given edit access to the report documents.
