High-level missing things:
 * Conflict of interest
 * Report decision making procedure
 * Documentation - including how to exclude WG members who have a conflict of interest
 * On-boarding and off-boarding

# On-boarding and off-boarding

* What should the process be for adding or removing committee members?
  * Suggestion for initial setup:
    * Any member of the Code of Conduct work group can nominate new enforcement team members
    * Anyone can self-nominate by emailing the Code of Conduct work group
    * The Code of Conduct work group will vote on each enforcement team member, and a two-thirds majority will confirm the member
  * Suggestion for after the first Code of Conduct enforcement team is confirmed by the work group:
    * Any member of the enforcement team can nominate new enforcement team members
    * Anyone can self-nominate by emailing the enforcement team
    * The enforcement team will vote on each new enforcement team member, and a two-thirds majority will confirm the member

When deciding whether to add a new Code of Conduct committee member, or remove a current member:

* **Describe the new member's qualifications.** Have they served as a Code of Conduct committee member in a different community or event, or are they new to report evaluation? Are they a part of the community? Are they connected to marginalized groups in the community?
* **Call a vote.** This can be done privately, in the case of removing a current member.
* **Vote.** Changes to the Code of Conduct committee members will be decided by a two-thirds majority of all the Code of Conduct committee members.
