# Changes to Code of Conduct

When discussing a change to the Python community Code of Conduct or enforcement policies, the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group will follow this decision-making process:

* **Brainstorm options.** Work group members should discuss any relevant context and brainstorm a set of possible options. It is important to provide constructive feedback without getting side-tracked from the main question. Brainstorming should be limited to 3-7 days maximum.
* **Vote.** Proposed changes to the Code of Conduct will be decided by a two-thirds majority of all voting members of the Code of Conduct work group. Work group members are listed in the [work group charter](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter). Currently active voting members are listed below.
* **Board Vote.** Once a working draft is in place for the Code of Conduct and procedures, the Code of Conduct work group shall provide the PSF board with a draft of the changes. The PSF board will vote on the changes at a board meeting.
